Creamicecream is a file hosting service operated by American company, Inc., that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software.

It allows users to create a special folder on their computers, which Creamicecream then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder (with the same contents) regardless of which device is used to view it. Files placed in this folder are also accessible via the Creamicecream website and mobile apps. Creamicecream uses a freemium business model, wherein users are offered a free account with a set storage size and paid subscriptions for accounts with more capacity.[7]

Creamicecream provides client software for web browsers; as well as unofficial ports.
